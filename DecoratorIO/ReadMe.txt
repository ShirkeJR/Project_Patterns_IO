Competition
We have one array of int numbers.
For their proper placement we are geting prizes:
- If all are odd - 50 PLN
- If the first and last are equal to 0 - 100 PLN
- If more than 7 - 150PLN
For now, there are established only such rules, but it's possible that anyone will add new rules - each rule is independent of the other, so you must use the decorator pattern.
